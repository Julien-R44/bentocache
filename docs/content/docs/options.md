summary: The list of options available to configure BentoCache

# Options

Here at the different possible options of BentoCache. Some of them are configurable, either **globally**, at the **store level** or at **operation level** ( when calling core methods like `getOrSet`, `get`, etc. ).

Order of precedence is as follows: **1. Operation level > 2. Store level > 3. Global level.**

```ts
// title: Options levels
const bento = new BentoCache({
  default: 'memory',

  // Global level ðŸ‘‡
  ttl: '1h',
  gracePeriod: {
    enabled: true,
    duration: '6h',
    fallbackDuration: '5m'
  },

  stores: {
    memory: bentostore({
      // Store level ðŸ‘‡
      ttl: '30m',
      gracePeriod: { enabled: false }
    })
  }
})

bento.getOrSet('key', () => fetchFromDb(), {
  // Operation level ðŸ‘‡
  ttl: '1h',
  gracePeriod: { enabled: true }
})
```

## TTL Formats

Quick note about TTLs and durations. Everywhere you are asked to provide a TTL or a duration, you can provide either:

- a `number` in milliseconds.
- a `string`, duration in human-readable format, see [lukeed/ms](https://github.com/lukeed/ms) for more details on the different formats accepted.
- In some cases : a `null` value. In the context of a TTL, this means that the item will never expire for example.

## List of options

### `prefix`

Default: `undefined`

Levels: `global`, `store`

This prefix will be added in front of all your cache keys. This can be useful, for example, in the case where you share a Redis with another application. Particularly when you need to call `.clear()`. Without a prefix, all keys will be deleted, even those not added by your application.

### `ttl`

Default: `30s`

Levels: `global`, `store`, `operation`

The TTL of the item to cache. See [TTL formats](#ttl-formats).

### `suppressL2Errors`

Default: `false`

Levels: `global`, `store`, `operation`

If `false`, then errors thrown by your L2 cache will be rethrown, and you will have to handle them yourself. Otherwise, they will just be ignored.

Note that in some cases, like when you use [Grace Periods](./grace_periods.md), errors will not be thrown, even if this option is set to `false`. Since this is the whole point of grace periods.

### `earlyExpiration`

Default: `undefined`

Levels: `global`, `store`, `operation`

Percentage of the TTL (between 0 and 1) that corresponds to the moment from which bentocache should launch a background refresh of your key. For example, if your TTL is `10m`, and your `earlyExpiration` is `0.8`, then a background refresh will be launched when the key is requested and there is less than 2 minutes of TTL remaining.

### `gracePeriod`

Default `undefined`

Levels: `global`, `store`, `operation`

An object to configure the [grace period](./grace_periods.md):
```ts
{
  enabled: true,
  duration: '6h',
  fallbackDuration: '5m'
}
```

### `timeouts`

Default: `undefined`
Levels: `global`, `store`, `operation`

An object to configure the [timeouts](./timeouts.md)

```ts
{
  soft: '1s',
  hard: '3s'
}
```

Basically, when invoking a factory : 

- If the factory takes more than `soft` to resolve and a graced/stale value is still available, then it will be returned. Factory will continue to run in the background.
- If the factory takes more than `hard` to resolve, then an exception will be thrown. You need to handle it yourself.

### `lockTimeout`

Default: `undefined`

Levels: `global`, `store`, `operation`

The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) that the in-memory lock for [stampeded protection](./stampede_protection.md) can be held. If the lock is not released before this timeout, it will be released automatically. 

This is usually not needed, but can provide an extra layer of protection against theoretical deadlocks.

### `logger`

Default: `undefined`.

Levels: `global`

Only configurable at the BentoCache level.

See [logger](./digging_deeper/logging.md) for more details.

### `emitter`

Default: `new EventEmitter()`.

Levels: `global`

Only configurable at the BentoCache level.

See [events](./digging_deeper/events.md) for more details.
